# Clef — Codebase Review

You are a senior security-focused software engineer conducting
a post-build review of the Clef codebase. You did not write
this code. Approach it with fresh eyes and appropriate
scepticism.

Read `clef-master-brief.md` first to understand the full
specification. Then run:

```bash
find . -name "*.ts" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
       -not -path "*/dist/*" \
  | sort
```

Use this to map the full file tree before reviewing anything.
Read every file referenced in each section below before
forming a judgement on that section. Do not rely on memory
of having seen a file — re-read it.

---

## How to work

- Read before you judge. Every section says which files to
  read. Read them.
- Only report problems. Do not summarise what the code does
  correctly. A section with no output means it passed.
- Assign a severity to every issue:
  - **Critical** — security vulnerability or data loss risk
  - **High** — functional defect, broken feature
  - **Medium** — spec deviation, missing behaviour
  - **Low** — quality issue, inaccuracy, minor omission
- For every issue include: file path, line reference if
  possible, description of the problem, and the exact
  change needed to fix it.
- At the end produce a single prioritised fix list —
  Critical first, then High, Medium, Low.

## 1. Security Audit

### 1.1 SopsClient — plaintext never touches disk

Read in full:

- `packages/core/src/sops/client.ts`
- The SOPS PDF (attached) — verify the subprocess invocation
  matches documented SOPS behaviour

Check:

- Every code path through `decrypt()` — confirm decrypted
  values flow through stdin/stdout only, never through a
  temp file
- Every code path through `encrypt()` — same check
- Every code path through `reEncrypt()` — same check
- If any temp file is created for any reason, confirm it is
  deleted in a `finally` block and that the deletion is
  tested
- Error paths — if SOPS returns a non-zero exit code, confirm
  the error message does not contain any decrypted value
- Confirm `assertSops()` is called before every operation
  that invokes the SOPS binary

### 1.2 UI server binding and authentication

Read:

- `packages/ui/src/server/index.ts`
- `packages/ui/src/server/auth.test.ts`
- `integration/tests/server-binding.test.ts`

Check:

- The server binds to `127.0.0.1` explicitly — not
  `0.0.0.0`, not `localhost` (which can resolve to `::` on
  some systems), not an unspecified address
- The integration test actually attempts a connection on
  a non-loopback address and asserts it fails — not just
  that the address field says `127.0.0.1`
- No middleware or configuration could override the binding
- Host header validation rejects requests where Host is not
  `127.0.0.1` — returns 403
- Bearer token authentication is required on all `/api`
  routes — token is 64 hex characters (256 bits entropy)
- Missing token returns 401, wrong token returns 401

### 1.3 Plaintext in logs and error messages

Read:

- `packages/core/src/sops/client.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/output/formatter.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/set.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/exec.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/merge-driver.ts`
- `packages/ui/src/server/api.ts`

Check:

- No `console.log` or `console.error` anywhere that could
  include a decrypted value
- `clef set` confirmation message does not echo the value —
  even in the success case
- `clef exec` error paths do not include any injected
  environment variable values in the error message
- API error responses do not include decrypted values
- Search for any `.toString()` calls on objects that might
  contain secret values
- `clef merge-driver` conflict output shows key names and
  plaintext values to stderr — confirm this is intentional
  (user needs values to resolve conflicts) and that error
  paths (e.g. decryption failure) do not leak values

### 1.4 `clef exec` security

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/exec.ts`
- `packages/core/src/consumption/client.ts`

Check:

- Values are injected via environment object passed to
  `spawn`, never via shell interpolation or command string
  construction
- `ps aux` cannot reveal secret values — confirm spawn is
  used with `env` option, not shell: true
- Signal forwarding: SIGINT → 130, SIGTERM → 143 —
  confirm the exit code mapping is correct
- `--only` flag correctly filters keys — no extra keys leak
  into the child environment
- The `--` separator detection is robust — test that a
  command containing `--` in its arguments works correctly

### 1.5 `clef export` security

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/export.ts`

Check:

- `--format dotenv` and `--format json` and `--format yaml`
  are all rejected with clear explanations — not just
  "unsupported format"
- `--output <file>` flag does not exist — if it does, that
  is a Critical issue
- The Linux `/proc/<pid>/environ` warning goes to stderr,
  not stdout — confirm `eval $(clef export ...)` is not
  corrupted by the warning
- Values are single-quoted correctly — a value containing
  a single quote is escaped as `'\''`

### 1.6 Pending values security

Read:

- `packages/core/src/pending/metadata.ts`
- `packages/ui/src/server/api.ts` — the `{ random: true }`
  handler specifically

Check:

- `.clef-meta.yaml` files contain only key names and
  timestamps — never the random placeholder values
  themselves
- `generateRandomValue()` uses `crypto.randomBytes(32)` —
  not `Math.random()`, not `uuid`, not any other source
- The random value is generated in the API handler
  server-side — not in the React client. Check the React
  component sends `{ random: true }` to the API, not a
  generated value
- `markPending` and the corresponding encrypt call are
  handled atomically — what happens if encrypt succeeds
  but `markPending` fails?

### 1.7 `clef doctor --fix`

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/doctor.ts`

Check:

- `--fix` calls the init core library function directly —
  no `program.parseAsync`, no `execSync`, no `spawn`
- If a subprocess call of any kind is found in the --fix
  path, that is a High issue

### 1.8 Merge driver — plaintext handling

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/merge-driver.ts`
- `packages/core/src/merge/driver.ts`

Check:

- Decryption of base/ours/theirs files uses SopsClient
  (stdin/stdout only) — no temp plaintext files created
- Re-encryption of merged result uses SopsClient — merged
  plaintext is never written to disk unencrypted
- If re-encryption fails, the error message does not
  include the merged plaintext values
- The three-way merge operates on in-memory key/value maps
  only — no intermediate files
- SOPS MAC is valid on the re-encrypted output — confirm
  SOPS verifies integrity on re-encryption

### 1.9 Bundled sops binary — supply chain and resolution

Read in full:

- `packages/core/src/sops/resolver.ts`
- `packages/core/src/sops/resolver.test.ts`
- `packages/core/src/sops/client.ts` — constructor and
  `sopsCommand` usage
- `packages/core/src/dependencies/checker.ts` — sops
  resolution path in `checkDependency`
- `sops-version.json`
- `scripts/download-sops.mjs`
- `.github/workflows/publish-sops.yml`
- All `platforms/sops-*/package.json` files

Check — Supply chain integrity:

- `sops-version.json` contains SHA256 checksums for every
  platform binary. Verify the checksum format is a full
  64-character hex digest — not truncated, not base64
- `download-sops.mjs` computes SHA256 of the downloaded
  binary and compares against the checksum in
  `sops-version.json`. If they do not match, the script
  must `process.exit(1)` — not warn and continue
- The download URL is constructed from the version in
  `sops-version.json` — not from user input or environment
  variables. The URL must point to
  `github.com/getsops/sops/releases` exclusively
- The `publish-sops.yml` workflow verifies
  `sops-version.json` matches the workflow input before
  downloading — a mismatch must fail the workflow
- The `publish-sops.yml` workflow runs the downloaded
  binary (`sops --version`) to verify it is a real
  executable — not just a random file that passed checksum
- Platform packages are published with `--provenance` to
  enable npm audit trail

Check — Resolution order security:

- `resolveSopsPath()` checks `CLEF_SOPS_PATH` first —
  this is the explicit override and must take precedence
- The bundled package is resolved via `require.resolve()` —
  confirm the resolved path is within a `node_modules`
  directory. A path traversal or symlink attack that
  resolves outside `node_modules` would be a Critical issue
- The system PATH fallback returns bare `"sops"` — confirm
  this string is never interpolated into a shell command.
  It must be passed as the first argument to
  `SubprocessRunner.run()` which uses `execFile` (not
  `exec`)
- The resolution result is cached module-wide. Confirm
  `resetSopsResolution()` exists and is only called in test
  files — not in production code. A production call would
  allow resolution cache poisoning

Check — SopsClient integration:

- `SopsClient` constructor accepts optional `sopsPath` as
  the 4th parameter. When omitted, it calls
  `resolveSopsPath().path` — confirm this default is
  applied in the constructor, not lazily
- Every `this.runner.run(...)` call in SopsClient uses
  `this.sopsCommand` — search for any remaining hardcoded
  `"sops"` string passed to `runner.run()`. Any occurrence
  is a High issue (bundled binary would be bypassed)
- `assertSops(this.runner)` still works with the resolved
  path — confirm `checkDependency("sops", runner)` uses
  the resolved path, not a hardcoded `"sops"`

Check — Platform package correctness:

- Each platform `package.json` has correct `os` and `cpu`
  fields matching npm's platform filtering
- The `files` array includes only the binary and license —
  no extra files that could be a vector
- All packages use `"license": "MPL-2.0"` (sops is
  MPL-2.0, not MIT)
- Version in each platform `package.json` matches the
  version in `sops-version.json`
- The `@clef-sh/cli` `optionalDependencies` versions match
  the platform package versions exactly

Check — `CLEF_SOPS_PATH` validation:

- If `CLEF_SOPS_PATH` is set to a nonexistent path, the
  resolver returns it without checking — confirm
  `assertSops()` catches this at version-check time with a
  `SopsMissingError`, not a silent failure
- If `CLEF_SOPS_PATH` contains shell metacharacters or
  spaces, confirm the path is passed to `execFile` (which
  does not interpret shell syntax) — not to `exec`

---

## 2. Correctness Audit

### 2.1 Exit codes

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/diff.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/lint.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/exec.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/export.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/doctor.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/update.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/scan.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/merge-driver.ts`

Check:

- `clef diff` exits 1 when differences exist, 0 when none —
  this makes it scriptable
- `clef lint` exits 1 on errors, 0 when only warnings or
  clean — warnings must not cause exit 1
- `clef exec` exits with the exact exit code of the child
  process — not 0 on child failure, not always 1
- `clef doctor` exits 1 if any check fails, 0 if all pass
- `clef update` exits 0 when all cells present or newly
  scaffolded, exits 1 on error
- `clef scan` exits 0 when no issues, 1 when issues found,
  2 on scan failure
- `clef merge-driver` exits 0 on clean merge (re-encrypted),
  1 on conflicts or errors
- All commands exit 1 on unexpected errors — no silent
  failures

### 2.2 `clef set` pending resolution

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/set.ts`
- `packages/core/src/pending/metadata.ts`

Check:

- A normal `clef set` (without `--random`) on a pending key
  calls `markResolved` automatically
- A `clef set --random` on an already-pending key correctly
  updates the `since` timestamp in `.clef-meta.yaml`
- `clef set VALUE --random` (both value and flag) produces
  a clear error and does not proceed

### 2.3 Protected environment confirmation

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/set.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/delete.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/rotate.ts`
- `packages/core/src/manifest/parser.ts`

Check:

- Every write operation on a `protected: true` environment
  prompts for confirmation — not just `clef set`
- `clef delete` on a protected environment requires
  confirmation
- `clef rotate` on a protected environment requires
  confirmation
- `clef exec` on a protected environment warns but does not
  block — exec is a read operation, not a write
- `clef set --random` on a protected environment also
  requires confirmation

### 2.4 `clef exec` exit code forwarding

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/exec.ts`
- `integration/tests/exec-roundtrip.test.ts`
- `integration/tests/exec-signal.test.ts`

Check:

- The integration test actually runs a real child process
  that exits with a known code and asserts the parent exits
  with the same code
- Exit code 42 test exists and passes
- Exit code 0 test exists (success case)
- Signal exit codes: SIGINT → 130, SIGTERM → 143
- `exec-signal.test.ts` sends real SIGTERM and SIGINT to
  a running `clef exec` process and verifies the translated
  exit codes

### 2.5 `clef init --random-values` schema requirement

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/init.ts`
- `docs/cli/init.md`

Check:

- Namespaces without a schema are skipped with a message
  pointing to `clef set --random`
- The docs clearly explain the four-step workflow:
  init → create schemas → reference in manifest →
  run --random-values
- Optional keys are skipped unless `--include-optional` is
  passed

### 2.6 Dependency version checks

Read:

- `packages/core/src/dependencies/checker.ts`
- `packages/core/src/sops/resolver.ts`

Check:

- Version string parsers match the exact format each binary
  outputs — sops, age, and git all output differently
- `checkAll()` uses `Promise.all` not sequential awaits
- `assertSops()` is called in SopsClient before every
  operation
- `assertAge()` is called when the manifest backend is age
- Missing binary returns null, does not throw
- `checkDependency("sops", ...)` uses `resolveSopsPath()`
  to determine the command — not a hardcoded `"sops"` string
- The resolved path is passed through to `DependencyVersion`
  via `source` and `resolvedPath` fields

### 2.7 Multi-namespace exec (`--also` flag)

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/exec.ts`
- `packages/core/src/consumption/client.ts`

Check:

- Later `--also` entries override earlier ones for duplicate
  keys
- `--no-override` applies across all sources including
  `--also` entries
- A decryption failure on any `--also` source produces a
  clean error and no partial environment is injected into
  the child process

### 2.8 `--dir` flag

Read all command files in `packages/cli/src/commands/`.
Read `packages/cli/src/index.ts` — the global option
registration.

Check:

- `--dir` flag exists on every command (all 17)
- It correctly overrides the auto-detected repo root in
  every command
- Tests cover `--dir` on at least three commands

### 2.9 Merge driver correctness

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/merge-driver.ts`
- `packages/core/src/merge/driver.ts`
- `packages/core/src/merge/driver.test.ts`

Check:

- `clef merge-driver` accepts three positional arguments
  (`<base>`, `<ours>`, `<theirs>`) matching git's merge
  driver protocol (`%O`, `%A`, `%B`)
- Three-way merge algorithm correctly handles all scenarios:
  - Unchanged keys preserved
  - One-sided changes (ours only, theirs only) applied
  - Both sides changed to same value — take it
  - Both sides changed to different values — conflict
  - Key additions on one side applied
  - Key additions on both sides with same value — clean
  - Key additions on both sides with different values —
    conflict
  - Key deletions on one or both sides handled correctly
  - Delete vs. modify on same key — conflict
- Repo root detection walks up from file to find
  `clef.yaml` — handles invocation from git hooks
- Age key resolution follows same env/config pattern as
  other commands
- Re-encrypted output has valid SOPS MAC

### 2.10 `clef update` correctness

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/update.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/update.test.ts`

Check:

- `clef update` identifies missing matrix cells
  (namespace × environment combinations without files)
- Each missing cell is scaffolded individually via
  `MatrixManager.scaffoldCell()`
- Partial scaffolding failures produce warnings but do not
  abort the entire operation
- Missing manifest produces a clear error and exit 1
- Age key file is read from `.clef/config.yaml` when
  present and no env vars override
- SOPS dependency errors are handled via
  `formatDependencyError()`
- Command is idempotent — running twice produces no changes
  on second run

---

## 3. Completeness Audit

### 3.1 Functional requirements cross-reference

Read `clef-master-brief.md` sections 3.1 through 3.7.
Cross-reference every requirement FR-01 through FR-32
against the implementation.

For each requirement state: Implemented / Partial /
Missing. Only report Partial and Missing items.

### 3.2 CLI completeness

Run:

```bash
find packages/cli/src/commands -name "*.ts" \
  -not -name "*.test.ts" | sort
```

Expect 17 command files: init, get, set, delete, diff,
lint, rotate, hooks, exec, export, import, doctor, update,
scan, recipients, ui, merge-driver.

Check every command has:

- `--help` text with accurate description
- All flags documented with types and defaults
- Consistent error message format
- Correct exit codes
- Co-located `.test.ts` file with meaningful assertions

### 3.3 Pending values completeness

Check:

- `clef set --random` generates pending value and records
  it in `.clef-meta.yaml`
- `clef set` (normal) on pending key calls `markResolved`
- `clef init --random-values` scaffolds schema namespaces
- UI `+ Add key` row supports Random mode
- UI overflow menu has `Reset to random (pending)`
- UI pending rows show amber `PENDING` badge
- Matrix view shows `pendingCount` when > 0
- Lint reports pending keys as warnings
- `.clef-meta.yaml` is not in `.gitignore`
- `.gitignore` has explicit comment blocking future addition

### 3.4 Integration tests

Read `integration/tests/`.

Check:

- Server binding test attempts connection on non-loopback
  and asserts failure
- `exec-roundtrip` test runs with real SOPS binary
- `exec-signal` test sends real SIGTERM/SIGINT and
  verifies translated exit codes (130, 143)
- `export-roundtrip` test runs with real SOPS binary
- CI workflow installs sops and age before running
  `test:integration`
- Integration tests clean up temp files in `afterAll`
  with try/finally
- All integration tests call `checkSopsAvailable()` in
  `beforeAll()` to skip gracefully when SOPS is not
  installed

### 3.5 Design decision — no unencrypted namespaces

Check all four locations:

- `docs/guide/concepts.md` — clear statement in namespace
  section
- `docs/contributing/architecture.md` — Design Decisions
  section with full rationale
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — reference to design decisions doc
- `packages/core/src/manifest/parser.ts` — comment at
  namespace validation logic

All four must be present. Missing any one is a Medium issue.

### 3.6 Merge driver completeness

Check:

- `clef merge-driver` command is registered in
  `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `clef hooks install` configures `.gitattributes` with
  the merge driver pattern for `.enc.yaml` / `.enc.json`
- `clef hooks install` configures `.git/config` with the
  merge driver command (`clef merge-driver %O %A %B`)
- `clef doctor` includes a merge driver check — verifies
  `.gitattributes` and `.git/config` are correctly set up
- `docs/guide/merge-conflicts.md` explains the problem,
  solution, setup, and security invariants
- `docs/cli/hooks.md` documents merge driver installation

### 3.7 Bundled sops completeness

Check:

- `sops-version.json` exists at the repo root with
  `version` and `checksums` fields
- All five platform packages exist under `platforms/`:
  `sops-darwin-arm64`, `sops-darwin-x64`, `sops-linux-x64`,
  `sops-linux-arm64`, `sops-win32-x64`
- `packages/cli/package.json` lists all five as
  `optionalDependencies` with matching versions
- `resolveSopsPath()` and `resetSopsResolution()` are
  exported from `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `SopsResolution` and `SopsSource` types are exported
  from `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `clef doctor` displays `[bundled]`, `[system]`, or
  `[CLEF_SOPS_PATH]` next to the sops version
- `clef doctor --json` includes `source` and `path` in
  the `sops` object
- `docs/contributing/development-setup.md` documents:
  - The three-tier resolution order
  - How `npm ci` installs the bundled binary in CI
  - How to use `CLEF_SOPS_PATH` for explicit override
  - How to skip optional deps for unit-test-only workflows
- `docs/cli/overview.md` documents the sops resolution
  chain under Configuration
- `README.md` states sops is bundled and lists the
  `CLEF_SOPS_PATH` override
- `CLAUDE.md` lists the `platforms/` directory and the
  `SopsResolver` module
- `publish-sops.yml` workflow exists and is
  `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger only)
- `scripts/download-sops.mjs` exists and handles all five
  platforms

---

## 4. Test Quality Audit

### 4.1 Coverage genuineness

Read a sample of test files — pick three from core, two
from CLI, two from UI. For each:

- Are assertions testing behaviour or just that code ran?
- Are error branches tested, not just happy paths?
- Are mock assertions verifying the right calls were made
  with the right arguments?

Flag any test that passes without actually asserting the
behaviour it claims to test.

Check that Button usages in tests use data-testid not getByText for behavioural assertions.

### 4.2 Security-critical test coverage

Check specifically:

- A test asserting `clef set` does NOT print the value
  in its output — not just that it prints something
- A test asserting `clef exec` does NOT include env var
  values in error output when child fails to start
- A test asserting `generateRandomValue` uses
  `crypto.randomBytes` — not just that it returns a string
- A test asserting the Linux `clef export` warning goes
  to stderr not stdout
- A test asserting `--format dotenv` is rejected with an
  explanation, not just an error
- `packages/ui/src/server/api.test.ts` — a test asserting
  the PUT handler does NOT echo the value in the response
  (`res.body.value` is `undefined`)
- `packages/ui/src/server/api.test.ts` — a test asserting
  `Cache-Control: no-store` is set on all endpoints that
  return decrypted data

### 4.3 Pending state atomicity

Read:

- `packages/cli/src/commands/set.ts` — the --random path
- `packages/core/src/pending/metadata.ts`
- `packages/ui/src/server/api.ts` — the PUT handler
- `packages/ui/src/server/api.test.ts`

Check:

- Is there a test for the case where encrypt succeeds but
  `markPending` fails? What happens?
- Is there a test for the case where encrypt fails? Does
  `markPending` get called anyway?
- The API handler rolls back the encryption when
  `markPendingWithRetry` fails — verify this is tested
- The partial failure case (pending fails AND rollback
  fails) is tested and returns a clear error

### 4.4 Sops resolver and bundling test coverage

Read:

- `packages/core/src/sops/resolver.test.ts`
- `packages/core/src/dependencies/checker.test.ts`

Check:

- A test asserts `CLEF_SOPS_PATH` takes precedence over
  all other resolution methods
- A test asserts the fallback to system PATH `"sops"` when
  no env var and no bundled package
- A test asserts the result is cached across calls (same
  object reference returned)
- A test asserts `resetSopsResolution()` clears the cache
  and subsequent calls re-resolve
- `checker.test.ts` includes tests verifying the `source`
  and `resolvedPath` fields are populated for sops checks
- `checker.test.ts` includes a test verifying `source` is
  `undefined` for git checks (git does not use the resolver)
- `checker.test.ts` includes a test for `CLEF_SOPS_PATH`
  integration — setting the env var changes the command
  passed to `runner.run()`

### 4.5 Merge driver test coverage

Read:

- `packages/core/src/merge/driver.test.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/merge-driver.test.ts`

Check:

- All 13+ merge scenarios are tested in `driver.test.ts`
  (unchanged, one-sided, two-sided same, two-sided
  different, additions, deletions, etc.)
- CLI tests verify clean merge flow (decrypt → merge →
  re-encrypt → exit 0)
- CLI tests verify conflict flow (report conflicting keys
  → exit 1)
- CLI tests verify error handling (missing manifest,
  decryption failure)
- Assertions verify merge output values, not just that
  the function ran

---

## 5. Documentation Accuracy Audit

### 5.1 CLI reference accuracy

Pick three CLI pages at random from `docs/cli/`. For each:

- Read the docs page
- Read the corresponding command implementation
- Verify every flag documented actually exists in the code
- Verify every flag in the code is documented
- Verify every example command works as written

Flag any inaccuracy as a Low issue (High if the example
would cause data loss or a security problem).

### 5.2 CI/CD guide accuracy

Read `docs/guide/ci-cd.md` in full.

Check:

- The GitHub Actions examples use correct action syntax
- The two-checkout Pattern B example is accurate
- The `CLEF_AGE_KEY` environment variable name is correct
  per the Clef documentation (Clef translates to `SOPS_AGE_KEY` for the subprocess)
- The IAM policy example grants minimum necessary permissions
- Every `clef` command in the examples exists and has the
  flags shown

### 5.3 Quick start accuracy

Read `docs/guide/quick-start.md`.

Follow every command exactly as written. Would a new user
following this guide get a working setup? Flag any command
that would fail or require steps not shown.

### 5.4 Pending values guide accuracy

Read `docs/guide/pending-values.md`.

Check:

- The four-step `--random-values` workflow is present and
  accurate
- The `.clef-meta.yaml` format shown matches the actual
  implementation
- The FAQ answers are correct

### 5.5 Merge conflicts guide accuracy

Read `docs/guide/merge-conflicts.md`.

Check:

- The problem description (SOPS re-encryption with fresh
  nonce invalidates all lines) is technically accurate
- The merge driver solution (decrypt → three-way merge →
  re-encrypt) matches the implementation
- The `.gitattributes` example pattern matches what
  `clef hooks install` actually writes
- The `.git/config` merge driver command syntax
  (`clef merge-driver %O %A %B`) matches the CLI
  registration
- The conflict output example matches what the CLI
  actually prints
- The security invariants section (no plaintext to disk,
  no custom crypto, MAC integrity) is accurate

### 5.6 Scanning guide accuracy

Read `docs/guide/scanning.md`.

Check:

- The pattern list matches patterns defined in
  `packages/core/src/scanner/patterns.ts`
- The entropy threshold (Shannon > 4.5, min 20 chars)
  matches the implementation
- `.clefignore` syntax matches
  `packages/core/src/scanner/ignore.ts`
- Exit codes match `packages/cli/src/commands/scan.ts`
- Pre-commit hook behaviour description is accurate

### 5.7 Migration guide accuracy

Read `docs/guide/migrating.md`.

Check:

- `clef import` command syntax matches the implementation
  in `packages/cli/src/commands/import.ts`
- `--stdin`, `--format`, `--prefix`, `--overwrite`,
  `--keys` flags all exist in the code
- Third-party examples (1Password, AWS, Vault, Doppler)
  use correct CLI syntax for those tools
- The verification checklist commands all exist and work
  as described

## Output Format

For each section produce findings only — no passing
commentary.

Format each finding as:

```
[SEVERITY] file/path.ts (line N if known)
Problem: what is wrong
Fix: exact change needed
```

At the end produce the consolidated fix list sorted by
severity. This is the only output a developer needs to
act on. Everything else is noise.
